# devhost
changes windows host file entries, is used for testers that want to point to a Dev system by DNS name, and revert to live often.

It was just a quick thing for somebody who does lots of remote testing... it works but it has code inside form modules!! 

Was created with SharpDevelop c# 5x IDE.

I have added a compiled version, do your own AV scanning etc on it, or just compile it with the free sharpdevelop compiler to be sure!
